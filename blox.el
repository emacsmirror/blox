;;; Commentary:

;; blox provides functions to run Roblox tooling such as Rojo (see
;; https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) from Emacs.

;; blox doesn't bind any keys by itself; assuming `lua-mode' is
;; installed and loaded, a configuration might look something like
;; this:

;; (require 'blox)

;; (define-key lua-prefix-mode-map (kbd "s")
;;             #'blox-rojo-serve)
;; (define-key lua-prefix-mode-map (kbd "b")
;;             #'blox-rojo-build)
;; (define-key lua-prefix-mode-map (kbd "t")
;;             #'blox-test)

;; Or with `use-package':

;; (use-package blox
;;   :bind (:map lua-prefix-mode-map
;;               ("s" . blox-rojo-serve)
;;               ("b" . blox-rojo-build)
;;               ("t" . blox-test)))
